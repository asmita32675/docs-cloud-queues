Limits
~~~~~~~~~

Accounts are configured with default thresholds, or limits, that manage
capacity and prevent abuse of the system. The system recognizes default rate limits 
and absolute limits.


.. _cqueues-dg-api-info-limits-ratelimits:

Rate limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rate limits are thresholds that control the frequency at which the user can issue specific
API requests.  Limits are reset after a certain amount of time passes. 

With Cloud Queues, you can send over 25 million requests a day per
project ID (approximately 300 requests per second).

If your application slightly exceeds the rate limit, the Cloud Queues
service throttles your requests. The requests will take longer to
perform and will have more latency. If your application greatly exceeds
the 300 request per second rate limit, the API returns the HTTP response
code 429 Too Many Requests. If this occurs, reduce the application's
request rate to the Cloud Queues API by pausing slightly between each
request. If your application continues to hit this limit and you cannot
slow down the request rate, please contact Rackspace Cloud support.


.. note:: 
          If the default limits are too low for your particular application,
          please contact Rackspace Cloud support to request an increase. All
          requests require reasonable justification.

Absolute limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Absolute limits are fixed. Absolute limits control the total number of specific objects 
that the user can possess simultaneously.

The following table provides details about the absolute limits for the
Cloud Queues API.

+------------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------------+


.. note:: 
   For the 256 KB data limit for the message body JSON, if multiple
   messages are included in the request, this limit also applies to the sum
   of the message bodies added together. For example, you may have one
   message body of 256 KB, or up to 10 messages for which the sum of the 
   message bodies is 256 KB. A 400 error is triggered if a single message
   body or the sum of multiple message bodies exceed 256 KB in a single
   request.
