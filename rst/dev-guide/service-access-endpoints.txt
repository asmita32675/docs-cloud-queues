Service access and endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Cloud Queues service is a regionalized service that allows customers to select the   
regional endpoint where the Cloud Queues service is provisioned. 

.. tip:: 
     To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, review the 
     considerations for choosing a data center in the 
     `About regions`_  Rackspace Knowledge Center article.

If you are working with cloud servers that are in one of the Rackspace
data centers, using the ServiceNet endpoint in the same data center has
no network costs and provides a faster connection. ServiceNet endpoints
are prefixed with ``snet-``. ServiceNet is
the data center internet network. You can find the ServiceNet endpoint
URL value in the ``InternalURL`` attribute in the service catalog that
is returned in the authentication response.

If you are working with servers that are not in one of the Rackspace
data centers, you must use a public endpoint to connect. In your
authentication response, public endpoints are listed as ``publicURL`` in
the service catalog. If you are working with servers in multiple data
centers or have a mixed environment where you have servers in your data
centers and in Rackspace data centers, use a public endpoint because it
is accessible from all the servers in the different environments.


.. note::
   When you use base URLs, copy them directly from the service catalog
   rather than trying to construct them manually.

When you authenticate successfully, the Rackspace Cloud Identity returns 
the endpoint with your account ID appended to the URL. Note
the following information about account ID:

-  Account ID from Cloud Identity is the same as the Project ID given by
   the ``X-Project-Id`` header in Cloud Queues. (You might also see
   account ID or project ID referred to as tenant ID.)

-  You do not have to provide the account ID for the Cloud Queues API if
   you have the ``X-Project-Id`` header set. (In this case, the Cloud
   Queues API works with or without the account ID specified.)

-  Without the ``X-Project-Id`` header, you receive an auth error if the
   account ID is not in the URL.

-  If the account ID is in the URL, the Cloud Queues API will use that
   ID in place of the ``X-Project-Id`` header.

-  Account ID and Project ID refer to your Rackspace account number.

.. tip::
   If you do not know which data center you are working in or your account
   ID, you can find them in your `Cloud Control panel`_.
