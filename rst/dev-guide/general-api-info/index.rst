General API information
-----------------------
Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the
API operations reference for details about specific operations.

The Cloud Queues API is implemented using a RESTful web service
interface. Cloud Queues shares a common token-based authentication
system with other Rackspace Cloud products, which allows seamless access
among products and services.

.. note::
    All API requests to authenticate and operate Rackspace Cloud services are
    performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
