Common headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each request to the Cloud Queues API must include certain standard and
extended HTTP headers. These headers provide host, agent,
authentication, and other pertinent information to the server. The
following table provides the common headers used by the API.

**Table Common headers**

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Header                | Description                                        |
+=======================+====================================================+
| Host                  | Host name of the API                               |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Date                  | Current date and time                              |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Accept                | Media type desired; initially, only                |
|                       | ``application/json`` is supported.                 |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Accept-Encoding       | Specifies that the agent accepts gzip-encoded      |
|                       | response bodies                                    |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Content-Type          | ``application/json``                               |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Content-Length        | For **POST** or **PUT** requests, the length in    |
|                       | bytes of the message document being submitted      |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| X-Auth-Token          | Auth token                                         |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| X-Project-Id          | An ID for a project to which the value of          |
|                       | X-Auth-Token grants access. Queues are created     |
|                       | under this project.                                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Client-ID             | A UUID for each client instance. The UUID must be  |
|                       | submitted in its canonical form (for example,      |
|                       | 3381af92-2b9e-11e3-b191-71861300734c). The client  |
|                       | generates the Client-ID once. Client-ID persists   |
|                       | between restarts of the client so the client       |
|                       | should reuse that same Client-ID. Client-IDs       |
|                       | messages keep track of who posted them.            |
|                       | If you choose to use your own HTTP tools           |
|                       | to communicate with the Cloud Queues API, you must |
|                       | manage your own Client-IDs.                        |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
   The ``Accept`` header is required.
   
   All message-related operations require the use of ``Client-ID`` 
   in the headers to ensure that messages are not echoed back to the 
   client that posted them, unless the client explicity requests 
   this.
